\begin{abstract}
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor control, with gait abnormalities serving as key clinical indicators. This paper presents an attention-driven deep learning framework for automated PD detection and severity classification using gait time-series data. Our approach combines multi-scale temporal convolutional blocks with bidirectional LSTM and multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global gait patterns. We employ focal loss to address class imbalance and implement comprehensive data augmentation strategies including time masking, Gaussian noise injection, and mixup. Evaluated on the PhysioNet Gait in Parkinson's Disease dataset, our model achieves subject-level PD detection accuracy of 92\% and severity classification accuracy of 70\% using the Hoehn--Yahr scale. The multi-scale architecture with squeeze-excitation attention enables robust feature learning from variable-length gait sequences, while the subject-level aggregation strategy with voting mechanisms improves clinical reliability. Our work demonstrates the potential of attention-based deep learning for objective, non-invasive PD assessment in clinical settings.

\section{Introduction}
Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects approximately 10 million people worldwide and is characterized by progressive motor dysfunction including tremor, rigidity, and gait disturbances. Early detection and accurate severity assessment are crucial for effective disease management and treatment planning. Traditional clinical assessments rely on subjective observations and standardized rating scales such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn--Yahr staging, which suffer from inter-rater variability and limited temporal resolution.

Gait analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive biomarker for PD assessment. Patients with PD exhibit distinctive gait characteristics including reduced stride length, increased stride time variability, and altered cadence patterns. Recent advances in wearable sensors and computer vision have enabled continuous gait monitoring, generating rich time-series data suitable for machine learning analysis.

Deep learning approaches have shown remarkable success in medical time-series analysis, yet several challenges remain in PD gait assessment: (1) class imbalance; (2) variable-length sequences; (3) temporal dependencies at multiple scales; and (4) limited labeled data.

This paper addresses these challenges through an attention-driven deep learning framework that integrates: multi-scale temporal convolutional blocks, bidirectional LSTM layers, and multi-head self-attention; focal loss and weighted sampling for imbalance; and comprehensive augmentation strategies for improved generalization.

\textbf{Contributions.} Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A multi-scale architecture combining temporal CNNs, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms for gait analysis.
  \item Application of focal loss and weighted sampling to address class imbalance.
  \item Subject-level aggregation with a hybrid voting/averaging strategy for robust clinical predictions.
  \item Comprehensive evaluation on PhysioNet demonstrating 92\% PD detection and 70\% severity classification accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Gait Analysis for Parkinson's Disease}
Traditional gait analysis relies on spatiotemporal parameters including stride length, cadence, and swing time. Prior studies indicate PD patients exhibit increased gait variability and reduced stride length compared to controls. Wearable IMU sensors and depth cameras enable continuous monitoring without restricting natural movement patterns.

Markerless vision-based approaches using RGB-D cameras have achieved high accuracy in differentiating PD from healthy controls, but often rely on handcrafted features and lack hierarchical representation learning.

\subsection{Deep Learning for Gait Recognition}
GaitSet treats frames as orderless sets, GaitPart introduces part-based temporal modeling for occlusion robustness, and GaitGL combines global and local features through attention. Transformer-based models capture long-term dependencies. These insights inform medical gait modeling.

\subsection{Machine Learning for PD Severity}
Classical ML with engineered features attains moderate performance but struggles with complex temporal patterns. Deep models improve accuracy, yet many focus on binary PD detection rather than multi-class severity; interpretable attention mechanisms are increasingly important in healthcare.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}
We use the PhysioNet Gait in Parkinson's Disease Database, containing vertical ground reaction force time series from 93 subjects (73 PD, 20 controls). Recordings are sampled at ~100 Hz.

\textbf{Pipeline:} (1) Loading time-series from text with demographics; (2) Labels: PD vs control; severity via Hoehn--Yahr: Mild (\(\leq 2\)), Moderate (=3), Severe (\(\geq 4\)); (3) Normalization with StandardScaler fit on training data; (4) Windowing: length 384, hop 96; (5) Subject-level stratified split (85/15) to avoid leakage.

\subsection{Model Architecture}
\textbf{1) Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Frontend:} Enhanced temporal blocks with parallel 1D convolutions (kernel sizes 3/7/11), BatchNorm, ReLU. Branch outputs concatenated then reweighted via squeeze-excitation (SE). Stacked with channels 64$\rightarrow$128$\rightarrow$192$\rightarrow$256.

\textbf{2) Bidirectional LSTM:} A 3-layer BiLSTM (hidden dimension 160) models sequential dependencies; LayerNorm improves stability.

\textbf{3) Multi-Head Self-Attention:} An 8-head self-attention identifies discriminative temporal regions. Padding masks restrict attention to valid timesteps. Residual connections and LayerNorm are applied.

\textbf{4) Classification Heads:} Two heads: PD (320$\rightarrow$256$\rightarrow$128$\rightarrow$64$\rightarrow$2) and Severity (320$\rightarrow$256$\rightarrow$128$\rightarrow$64$\rightarrow$3) using LayerNorm, ReLU, and dropout.

\subsection{Handling Class Imbalance}
\textbf{Focal Loss:} \(\mathrm{FL}(p_t) = -\alpha (1-p_t)^{\gamma} \log(p_t)\), with \(\alpha=0.25\), \(\gamma=2.0\), emphasizes hard examples. Weighted random sampling with class weights \(w_c = N/(C\,N_c)\) balances batches.

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
Gaussian noise (std 0.03), time masking (prob 0.2, length 48), and mixup (Beta(0.3, 0.3), applied to 30\% of samples) improve generalization.

\subsection{Training Strategy}
Optimization with AdamW (lr $8\times 10^{-4}$, weight decay $10^{-2}$), cosine annealing with warm restarts, gradient clipping (max norm 1.0). Multi-task loss: \(\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{PD}} + 0.6\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{sev}}\). Early stopping monitors PD validation accuracy (patience 25).

\subsection{Subject-Level Aggregation}
Window-level predictions per subject are aggregated using a hybrid strategy: if a class achieves $\geq 60\%$ of votes, select the majority; otherwise average logits and predict from the mean.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\textbf{Implementation:} PyTorch; batch size 32; up to 120 epochs with early stopping; seed 42. Experiments run on CPU in the reported configuration.

\textbf{Metrics:} Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and full classification reports computed at the subject level after aggregation.

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Clinical Implications}
The 92\% PD detection accuracy approaches expert-level performance and supports automated screening. The 70\% severity accuracy offers quantitative assessments complementary to clinician judgment.

\subsection{Interpretability}
Attention weights can highlight salient temporal regions (e.g., stance, swing) associated with severity. Future work will visualize these patterns.

\subsection{Limitations}
Dataset size (93 subjects), single-modality (vertical GRF), and potential domain shift limit generalization; compute cost may challenge real-time deployment.

\subsection{Future Directions}
Multi-modal fusion (IMU + GRF), transfer learning from large gait corpora, gradient-based explainability, longitudinal modeling for progression, and clinical trials are promising directions.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented an attention-driven deep learning framework for PD detection and severity assessment from gait time series. Combining multi-scale temporal convolutions, BiLSTMs, and self-attention with focal loss, augmentation, and robust subject-level aggregation yielded 92\% PD detection and 70\% severity accuracy on PhysioNet, surpassing traditional and single-architecture baselines.
